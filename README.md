# Garuda Linux Sway Ricing by yurihikari

A simple aesthetic (at least for me) sway ricing on Garuda Linux.

## Important Dependencies
I use some apps not pre-included in the default Garuda Linux desktop. Please install them before using my dotfiles
to avoid any potential graphical issues.
- swaylock-effects (https://github.com/mortie/swaylock-effects)
- rofi-lbonn-wayland (https://github.com/lbonn/rofi)
- neofetch
- cava

**I didn't included personal apps like Youtube Music, Discord, VSCode and themes used in google-chrome etc.**

## Installation
There is no installation script yet. However, you can clone this repository and copy paste its content in your .config/ folder :

*Example* :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yurihikari/garuda-sway-config.git
cp -r /garuda-sway-config/* ~/.config
```

Or simply pick what you need from the files, and use it in your own.

## Keybinds
Please, refer to this file : https://github.com/yurihikari/garuda-sway-config/blob/c7fafa6c425014971525b5ff9bbf66f1facad5b4/sway/cheatsheet.md
Or use Meta+Shift+I to get a keybind sheet directly on your terminal.

## Waybar
Swap between each version of the waybar using the paintbrush icon on the bar.

## Colors
I'm using primarly Catppuccin Macchiato as my color palette. They also have lot of themes and tutorials
to install their theme and color palette into your favorite apps.

## Notice
I am using **Garuda Linux Sway** as my distro. Depending on your system, some stuff may not work or break.
Please be aware of that before starting using my dotfiles.

This is a work in permanent progress, some stuff may change drastically depending on my mood and taste.
I'll make different branches if i have to massively change the behavior of the current files so you can
keep track of the previous work versions.

I am not affiliated in any way to the official Garuda Linux Sway Team. This is a personal ricing using Garuda Linux Sway as the main distro.
